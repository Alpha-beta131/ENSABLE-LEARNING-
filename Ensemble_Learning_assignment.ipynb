        "At each split in a tree, instead of considering all features, a random subset of features is selected.\n",

        "C. Enables OOB Evaluation\n",

        "The 37% of samples not in a bootstrap sample can be used as a validation set for that tree.\n",

        "Sequence\tParallel (all models trained independently)\tSequential (each model depends on previous ones)\n",
        "Focus on Errors\tNo special focus on misclassified samples\tGives more weight to misclassified samples so the next model improves\n",
